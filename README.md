##About

![Dithered Memories Screenshot](https://unimplementedtrap.com/media/dm/Dithered-Memories-Screenshot.png)

This is just a fun little experiment where I taught myself rudimentary Macintosh programming using Symantec THINK C 5.0.

It’s designed to run on B&W 9” compact Macs and has been fully developed on my Macintosh SE running System 6.

Click “Begin” on the splash screen to start the animation. Click the mouse button again to quit the application.

Open up the application, put on your favourite vaporwave, synthwave, or other retro-inspired music and enjoy the show.

This is not a screensaver! If left running long enough it may cause screen burn-in.
